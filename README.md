# hello-world
Test of a GitHub repository.

I got my first real six string,
bought it at the five-and-dime,
played it till my fingers bled,
was the summer of sixty-nine.

Me and some guys from school,
had a band and we tried real hard,
Jimmy quit, Jody got married,
should have known, we never get far.
